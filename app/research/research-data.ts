  abstract:
    'We investigate the steady-state organization of active particles residing on an interface. Particle activity induces interface deformations, while the local shape of the interface guides particle movement. We consider multiple species of particles which can locally pull on the interface or push it. This coupled system exhibits a wide variety of behaviors, including clustering, anticlustering, diffusion, mixing, demixing, and localization. Our findings suggest that one can control surface properties by strategically adding or removing specific particle types. Furthermore, by adjusting particle activity levels, we can selectively disperse particle types, enabling precise manipulation of surface movement and geometry.',
