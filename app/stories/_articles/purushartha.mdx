It began with an unrighteous act—a sin of forbidden love. The scholar, a man whose enlightened reason was the pride of the kingdom, is sealed in an impenetrable cell. But no stone can hold a man touched by strange destinies. He simply vanished, dematerialized, leaving only shocked silence. He rips his princess from her very era, only to have fate snatch her away again. This time, there is no impossible escape, only a chilling, empty void. The scholar is dead. In the deep jungle, a dark mystic is born. Now, villagers whisper of a shadow who serves the Great Mother Goddess... a man bound to a terrible, spiritual quest. He is not a hunter. He is a living vow, forged in fire and paid in blood. The true mystery is not who he takes... but what dark boon he demands from the Goddess with the final sacrifice of a thousand souls.
