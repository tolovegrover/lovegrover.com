# Love Grover


As a PhD candidate in Physics at IISER Mohali, I've been fortunate to delve into the fascinating world of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, active matter, and computational simulations. My journey has involved developing and applying various research methodologies, contributing to peer-reviewed publications, and supporting undergraduate students in their learning.

I am deeply committed to the pursuit of scientific understanding, striving to contribute to our collective knowledge through careful experimentation, collaborative efforts, and clear communication of findings. I believe in the power of interdisciplinary approaches and continuous learning to address complex scientific challenges.
